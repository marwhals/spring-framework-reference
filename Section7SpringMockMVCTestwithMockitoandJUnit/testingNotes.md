# Testing Terminology

## Unit Tests / Unit Testing - Code written to test code under test
- Desinged to test specific sections of code
- Percentage of lines of code tested is code coverage
- Ideal coverage ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” is in the 70-80% range. *See line vs statement coverage*
- Should be 'unity' Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ and execute very fast
- Should have no external dependencies (mocking etc)
  - No database, or *Spring context* etc

# Integration Tests
- Designed to test behaviours between objects and parts of the overall system
  - Much larger scope
  - Can include the Spring Context, database and message brokers
  - Will run much slower than unit tests
- Functional Tests - Typically means you are testing the running application
  - Application is live, likely deployed in a known environment
  - Functional touch points are tested - (i.e: Using a web driver, calling web services / receiving messages, etc)

# Testing Hierarchy....
- All are important
- Majority should be unit tests
  - Foundation of software testing
  - Small, fast, light weight tests
  - Very detailed and specific
- Integration Tests should be next largest category
- Functional Tests are smallest and least detailed of the categories

# Testing Spring MVC Controllers is tricky........
- Controllers have a high degree of integration with the Spring MVC Framework
- Request path and HTTP Method decides which method to invoke
- Path variables are parsed from path
- JSON is bound to POJOs
- Response is expressed as an HTTP Response
- JUnit tests are NOT sufficient to test the framework interaction

*This motivated Spring MVC*
- Spring Mock MVC is a testing environment for the testing of Spring MVC controllers
  - Provide mocks of the Servlet runtime environment ðŸ“–ðŸ“–ðŸ“–ðŸ“–ðŸ“–*need to check this*
    - HTTP Request / Response, Dispatcher Servlet, etc
    - Simulates the execution of controller as if it was running under Spring within Tomcat
- Can be run with or without the Spring Context
- True unit test when run without the Spring Context
- Technically an Integration Test when used in conjunction with Spring Context

## Spring Boot Test Splices
- Spring Boot supports a concept of what is called Test Splices
- *Test Splices* bring up a targeted segment of the Auto-Configured Spring Boot Environment
  - i.e - Just the Database components; or just the web components
  - User defined Spring beans typically are NOT initialised
- @WebMvcTest - is a Spring Boot test splice which creates a MockMVC environment for the controller (or controllers) under test
  - Dependencies of controllers are NOT included

## Using Mocks
- Controller dependencies must be added to the Spring Context in the test environment
- Dependencies can be any proper implementation
  - Example of why we code to an interface, any implementation will work
- For testing, it is common to use mock objects
- Mocks allow you to supply a specific response for a given input
  - I.e - When method `potato()` return `chips`

## What is Mockito?
- Mockito - popular mocking framework for testing Java
- Mocks (aka Test Doubles) are alternate implementations of objects to replace real objects in tests
- Works well with Dependency Injection
- For the class under test, injected dependencies can be mocks

### Types of Mocks (aka Test Doubles)
- Dummy - Object used just to get the code to compile
- Fake - An object that has an implementation, but no production ready
- Stub - An object with pre-defined answers to method calls
- Mock - An object with pre-defined answers to method calls and has expectations of executions.
  - Can throw an exception if an unexpected invocation is detected
- Spy - In Mockito Spies are Mock like wrappers around the actual object.

### Important Terminology
- Verify - used to verify the number of times a mocked method has been called
- Argument Matcher - Matches arguments passed to Mocked Method and will allow or disallow
- Argument Captor - Captures arguments passed to a Mocked Method
  - Allows you to perform assertions of what was passed in to method

# Testing Controllers with Mocks
- Argument captors can be used to verify reqeust data is properly being parsed and passed to sevice layer
- Verify interactions can be used Mocked object was called
- Mock return values supply data back to controller
  - I.e - object returned when getById is called on service
- Mocks can also be instructed to throw exceptions to test exception handling.

# DRY (Refresher)
- Single Responsibility principle
- Define things once
  - Nicer code - Readability, maintainability etc
  - *Avoid inconsistencies*
